# i3-manager
This script enables you maintain multiple i3 configurations that share common code and associated Xsession files for launching i3 with these configurations. 

i3 on its own has no support for reusing code between config files and no way to manage having multiple of them, using this script you can create smaller configuration files and then declare how to combine them.
